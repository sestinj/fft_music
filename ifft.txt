You could instead represent timbre as a bar graph spectrogram (discrete on the frequency axis), which would be stored in an array of functions whose domains are time and whose ranges are amplitude.

Parameters to edit timbre:
- vibrato (shifting in the central frequency over time)
- Overtones/(Undertones?)
- Attack/decay/tremolo (change in overall amplitude over time)
- Shape of the sine wave (normal sine, square, jagged, make up other stuff (tan?))
- Anything else you can mess with or figure out.

- The lowest frequency is important to a tone and is called the fundamental. This should be used rather than your center of mass/centroid calculation to shift the tone
